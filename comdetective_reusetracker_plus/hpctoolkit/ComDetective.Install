Requirement
===============
- Linux kernel version 5.0.0 or higher
- An Intel machine that supports Processor Event-Based Sampling (PEBS), i.e. Nehalem or its successors
- An AMD machine that supports Instruction-Based Sampling (IBS), i.e. AMD family 10h or its successors

Installation
===============
0. (In AMD) Install the Linux kernel module for IBS from https://github.com/ParCoreLab/AMD_IBS_Toolkit 
1. Install hpctoolkit-externals from https://github.com/ParCoreLab/hpctoolkit-externals 
by typing the following command in the directory of hpctoolkit-externals:
	./configure && make && make install
2. Install the custom libmonitor from https://github.com/WitchTools/libmonitor 
by typing the following command in the directory of libmonitor:
	./configure --prefix=<libmonitor-installation directory> && make && make install 
3. Install HPCToolkit with ComDetective extensions from 
https://github.com/ParCoreLab/hpctoolkit pointing to the installations of 
hpctoolkit-externals and libmonitor from steps \#1 and \#2. 
Assuming that the underlying architecture is x86_64 and compiler is gcc, this step is performed with the following commands.

a. ./configure --prefix=<targeted installation directory for ComDetective> --with-externals=<directory of hpctoolkit externals>/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --with-libmonitor=<libmonitor-installation directory> 

b. make

c. make install

4. To install ComDetective by enabling attribution of detected communications to data objects, 
firstly install adamant from https://github.com/comdetective-tools/adamant 
by typing the following command in the directory adamant/src:
	make

After adamant is installed, go to HPCToolkit's directory, and execute the following commands:

a. ./configure --prefix=<targeted installation directory for ComDetective> --with-externals=<directory of hpctoolkit externals>/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --with-libmonitor=<libmonitor-installation directory> --with-libadm=<directory of adamant>

b. make

c. make install
